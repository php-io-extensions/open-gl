EGL window surfaces (`eglCreateWindowSurface`, `wl_egl_window_create/resize/destroy`, wayland-egl now required on Linux), `eglGetConfigAttrib`, `eglSurfaceAttrib`, the colour-space / SMPTE 2086 / CTA 861.3 / float-config constants, `GL_RGBA16F`, `GL_HALF_FLOAT`, `GL_RGB10_A2`, `GL_UNSIGNED_INT_2_10_10_10_REV`; strings sized for half-float and 10-bit pixels. Pi 5 Mesa (labwc) lists `EGL_KHR_gl_colorspace` and `EGL_EXT_pixel_format_float` only: no scRGB, PQ or P3 colour space. Its configs come deepest first (10, 8, 16 bit), and only 8-bit ones take a colour-space attribute; it accepts SMPTE 2086 attributes without listing the extension. Suite: Pi 30 passed; php84/zhp 25 passed, 5 skipped.

EGL swap interval, surface queries, and the swap with damage (`EGL_KHR_swap_buffers_with_damage`, present on the Pi's Mesa through a Wayland EGL window). Creating a GLFW window releases the thread's current context: the test restores the one taken before. Suite: Pi 26 passed; Homebrew PHP 8.4 NTS and ZTS 24 passed, 2 skipped (EGL is the Linux build).

Created the bundle for 0.10.0. The extension binds the shared OpenGL 4.1 core / OpenGL ES 3 calls, CGL on macOS, and EGL on Linux. The suite is 21 tests: 271 assertions on Homebrew PHP 8.4 NTS and ZTS, 298 assertions on the Pi (the EGL stub declares more constants than the CGL stub). Gate: stencil-then-cover triangle, 4× MSAA, blit resolve, read back, on CGL and on surfaceless EGL. The hypotenuse is neither solid colour on either. GLES rejects `GL_RGB` into a `GL_RGBA8` texture; the sizing test drains that error.

## 2026-10-05

Added `eglGetCurrentDisplay()`, `eglGetCurrentSurface()`, `EGL_DRAW` and `EGL_READ`: a caller that switches contexts puts back the display and surfaces with the context. Suite 22 tests on the Mac and the Pi (307 assertions there).

Added the four pixel-store skip constants. Strings for uploads and reads are sized with the skips: a skip left by another caller made `glReadPixels` write past a string sized without them. Suite 23 tests on Homebrew PHP 8.4 NTS and ZTS and the Pi.

## 2026-10-06

Added `GL_DRAW_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING` and `GL_READ_FRAMEBUFFER_BINDING`: a caller reads which framebuffer a toolkit bound before its render callback. Suite 24 tests on the Mac and the Pi.
